Command-line article search and tracking

Just a handy, low-maintenance tool to search thru articles by title, authors or year (and content? i forget). You manage the files on your own, and run the script as you want, no need to alert anything about changes you've made to the files.

Some much more thoughtful, explanatory stuff should go here, with screenshots.

Very rough state. Next things to fix:
* A single place to set the root directory for the articles
* An install script
